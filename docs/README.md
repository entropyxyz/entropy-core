## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Use Mermaid for diagrams
2. Keep diagrams clear and concise
3. Include explanatory text
4. Update this README if adding new files

## Diagram Types Used

1. **Flow Diagrams**
   - Show process flow
   - Use `graph TD` or `graph LR`
   - Include clear labels

2. **Sequence Diagrams**
   - Show interaction between components
   - Use `sequenceDiagram`
   - Include timing information

3. **Component Diagrams**
   - Show system structure
   - Use `graph TB` with subgraphs
   - Include connection types

## Best Practices

1. **Diagrams**
   - Use consistent naming
   - Include legends
   - Keep it simple
   - Add explanatory text

2. **Documentation**
   - Keep it up to date
   - Include examples
   - Cross-reference related docs
