# Docker Compose file for making an Entropy blockchain network.
# Currently, it's intended for LOCAL DEVNET FUNCTIONALITY ONLY.
# Things will get better and more generic, but for the moment
# this iteration is for simplifying the dogfooding and testing
# workflows our engineers use, and trying to cut down on some
# of the more complicated test code that spins up this kind of
# environment for their tests. Eventually, we will converge on
# a more canonical set of environments and configuration files.
