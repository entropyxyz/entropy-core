# Entropy Core

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/entropyxyz/entropy-core/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=bff4726b78a5f7c7771cb9ee8453cde0b8132d6f)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/entropyxyz/entropy-core/tree/master)

This repo contains the Entropy blockchain node, the [Threshold Signature Server](https://docs-api-entropy-core.vercel.app/entropy_tss) (evaluates programs, stores threshold keyshares, and coordinates threshold-signing), and misc. testing utilities for the network.

Our blockchain node is written with [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) using [Substrate's node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template).

## Documentation

You can build the API documentation for Entropy by invoking `cargo doc --no-deps --open`.
There is also [high level documentation for Entropy available here](https://docs.entropy.xyz).

## Getting Started

You can begin using this repository in a few different ways. This section describes a few of them.

### Getting started with Docker

This repository provides a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration that spins up a simple, two-node development blockchain. We provide [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/entropyxyz) that you can pull, or you can build from source.

**Do this** to use the Docker Compose configuration:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Make sure you also have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Confirm this by running:
    ```sh
    docker compose version
    ```
1. Bring up the configuration:
    ```sh
    docker compose up --detach # Detaching is optional.
    ```
1. Once running, if you have `--detach`ed your terminal from the containers' output streams, you can view them again like so:
    ```sh
    docker compose logs --follow # Following is also optional.
    ```
1. If you need to communicate directly with the threshold signature scheme server from your Docker host machine, you may also need to include its address in your local `/etc/hosts` file:
    ```sh
    echo "127.0.0.1	alice-tss-server bob-tss-server" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

Additional documentation on running a local network can be found [here](https://github.com/entropyxyz/meta/wiki/Local-devnet).

### Building from source

To build from source, you will need some development tooling installed on your local machine.

**Do this** to build Entropy from source.

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Substrate dependencies for your Operating System](https://docs.substrate.io/install/).
1. Building the chain node and threshold signature scheme (TSS) server binaries can be done by running:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

### Run: Single-Node Development Chain

Spinning up a local Entropy node for development and basic testing can be done with:

```sh
cargo run --release -p entropy -- --dev --rpc-external
```

Once built, the binary can also be run directly with:

```sh
./target/release/entropy --dev --rpc-external
```

Optionally, you can also run it with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/entropy -ldebug --dev --rpc-external
```

### Testing

Testing is done via `cargo test`.

An Entropy node binary is required in order to succesfully run the server tests.

You can manually provide a binary using the `ENTROPY_NODE` environment variable.

```sh
ENTROPY_NODE="/path/to/entropy" cargo test -p entropy-tss
```

Or, if no path is specified using `ENTROPY_NODE`, then the test suite will search in the `target`
folder for a binary. A debug or release binary will be chosen based on how the test suite is built.

For example, running `cargo test -p entropy-tss --release` will expect a release binary of the Entropy
node, which you can build in the following way: `cargo build -p entropy --release`.

To run individual tests you can specify the test in the following way:

```sh
cargo test -p entropy-tss --features unsafe -- test_sign_tx_no_chain --nocapture
```

### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-end

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect it with **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end
to interact with your chain. [Click here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) connecting the Apps to your local node template.

### Command line interface

A [simple command line interface client](https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-core/tree/master/crates/test-cli) is included in this repository for test purposes. This can be used with both the local docker-compose network and network deployments.

It is however only intended for use with test networks and has no secure private key storage. For a fully featured command line client see [entropyxyz/cli](https://github.com/entropyxyz/cli).

## Threshold Keys

- Keys for internal devnet use only (used in tests and for the local network built with docker-compose). These are not secure, they are here for convenience, do not use them for anything real.

## Pulling Metadata

Everytime a change to the chain's interface happens, metadata needs to be pulled. You'll need to install Subxt using `cargo install subxt-cli`. Then [run a development chain](#getting-started-with-docker) and then invoke [the `./scripts/pull_entropy_metadata.sh` script](./scripts/pull_entropy_metadata.sh).
