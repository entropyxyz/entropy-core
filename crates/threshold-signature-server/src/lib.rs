//! # Server
//!
//! The Threshold Server which stores key shares and participates in the signing protocol.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This exposes a HTTP API.
//!
//! ## The HTTP endpoints
//!
//! Some endpoints are designed to be called by the user, some by the entropy chain node,
//! and some by other instances of `server`:
//!
//! ### For the user
//!
//! Most user-facing endpoints take a [SignedMessage](crate::validation::SignedMessage) which
//! is an encrypted, signed message.
//!
//!
//! #### `/user/sign_tx` - POST
//!
//! [crate::user::api::sign_tx()]
//!
//! Called by a user to submit a transaction to sign (the new way of doing signing). Takes a
//! [UserSignatureRequest] encrypted in a [SignedMessage](crate::validation::SignedMessage).
//!
//! The response is chunked response stream. If the `UserSignatureRequest` could be processed, a
//! success response header is sent.  Then the signing protocol runs. When the it finishes, a single
//! message will be sent on the response stream with the result.
//!
//! If everything went well, the message will be a JSON object with a signle property "Ok"
//! containing an array which contains two strings.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! `{"Ok":["t7Mcxfdigds3RoT6OO/P+uMFE+XigRjUpn72E1cRU4Q2u7cVxZlsNRYhnahA+DvSNHBddj0HRz5u/XPlJT9QOQE=","32d7c0bfd90b546993d1ad51c542e1fc9dd1706c7bca395c8bd7f9642ae842400769488404dabd25d438cf08785a6750f95e7489245b8760af115f450d5f0a83"]}`
//!
//! The first string is a base64 encoded signature produced by the signing protocol. This is a 65
//! byte signature, the final byte of which is a
//! [recovery ID](https://docs.rs/synedrion/latest/synedrion/ecdsa/struct.RecoveryId.html).
//!
//! The second string is a hex encoded sr25519 signature of the signature made by the TSS server,
//! which can be used to authenticate that this response really came from this TSS server.
//!
//! In case signing was not successfull, the message will be a JSON object with a signle property "Err"
//! containing an error message, for example:
//!
//! `{"Err":"reqwest event error: Invalid status code: 500 Internal Server Error"}`
//!
//! Curl example for `user/sign_tx`:
//! ```text
//! curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
//!   -d '{"msg" "0x174...hex encoded signedmessage...","sig":"821754409744cbb878b44bd1e3dc575a4ea721e12d781b074fcdb808fc79fd33dd1928b1a281c0b6261a30536a7c0106a102f27dad1bc3ef475b626f0e57c983","pk":[172,133,159,138,33,110,235,27,50,11,76,118,209,24,218,61,116,7,250,82,52,132,208,169,128,18,109,59,77,13,34,10],"recip":[10,192,41,240,184,83,178,59,237,101,45,109,13,230,155,124,195,141,148,249,55,50,238,252,133,181,134,30,144,247,58,34],"a":[169,94,23,7,19,184,134,70,233,117,2,84,242,135,246,95,159,14,218,125,209,191,175,89,41,196,182,96,117,5,159,98],"nonce":[114,93,158,35,209,188,96,248,85,131,95,237]}' \
//!   -H "Accept: application/json" \
//!   http://127.0.0.1:3001/user/sign_tx
//! ```
//!
//! ### For the blockchain node
//!
//! #### `/user/new` - POST
//!
//! [crate::user::api::new_user()]
//!
//! Called by the off-chain worker (propagation pallet) during user registration.
//! This takes a parity scale encoded [entropy_shared::types::OcwMessageDkg] which tells us which
//! validators are in the registration group and will perform a DKG.
//!
//! ### For other instances of the threshold server
//!
//!   Takes a [UserRegistrationInfo] containing the users account ID and associated keyshare, wrapped
//!   in a [crate::validation::SignedMessage].
//!
//! - [`/ws`](crate::signing_client::api::ws_handler()) - Websocket server for signing and DKG protocol
//! messages. This is opened by other threshold servers when the signing procotol is initiated.
//!
//! - [`/validator/sync_kvdb`](crate::validator::api::sync_kvdb()) - POST - Called by another
//! threshold server when joining to get the key-shares from a member of their sub-group.
//!
//!   Takes a list of users account IDs for which shares are requested, wrapped in a
//!   [crate::validation::SignedMessage].
//!   Responds with a list of [crate::validation::SignedMessage]s each containing a serialized
//!   [synedrion::KeyShare].
//!
//! - [`/version`](crate::node_info::api::version()) - Get - get the node version info
//! - [`/heathlz`](crate::health::api::healthz()) - Get - get if the node is running
//! - [`/hashes`](crate::node_info::api::hashes()) - Get - get the hashes supported by the node

//! ### For testing / development
//!
//! [Unsafe](crate::unsafe::api) has additional routes which are for testing and development
//! purposes only and will not be used in production. These routes are only available if this crate
//! is compiled with the `unsafe` feature enabled.
//!
//! - [`unsafe/get`](crate::unsafe::api::unsafe_get()) - POST - get a value from the key-value
//!   store, given its key.
//! - [`unsafe/put`](crate::unsafe::api::put()) - POST - update an existing value in the key-value
//!   store.
//! - [`unsafe/delete`](crate::unsafe::api::delete()) - POST - remove a value from the key-value
//!   store, given its key.
//! - [`unsafe/remove_keys`](crate::unsafe::api::remove_keys()) - GET - remove everything from the
//!   key-value store.
//!
//! ## Pieces Launched
//!
//! - Axum server - Includes global state and mutex locked IPs
//! - [kvdb](entropy_kvdb) - Encrypted key-value database for storing key-shares and other data, build using
//! [sled](https://docs.rs/sled)
