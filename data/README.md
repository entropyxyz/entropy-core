# Data

This directory holds static data used during development, build, or run, or test time for Entropy.

Subdirectories in this directory map to an environment in which the data is relevant. For example:

* `./testnet/testnet-accounts.json` - Accounts endowed with a starting balance at the Entropy Network's testnet genesis block.
